//command signals explanation
/*
 * If good data is received from link, the trinket automatically notifies the m0
 * The first byte sent is an action command; it must be true or the m0 will not do anything
 * If the action command is false, the m0 will ignore it and write the normal altitude and ascent rate back as confirmation
 * If the action command is true, the m0 will force the valve to open for the amount of time specified in the next four bits
 *    In this case, the m0 will write back the amount of time open followed by a zero to confirm the command
 * If the action command is true, and the time specified is zero, the m0 will prevent the valve from opening unless commanded otherwise later 
 *    In this case, the m0 will write back a one followed by a zero
 * In all of these cases, the m0 will stop receiving data for WAIT_TIME (current 2 seconds) after the command
 * The m0 will also continuously update the ascent velocity and altitude which can be called by link at any time
 * 
 * On startup, the m0 will send the data stream {-1 -2.0} to the trinket to confirm that it can communicate
 * The user should then check link to ensure the xbee also transmits that data
 * 
 * If nothing is read, the trinket does nothing
 * If corrupted data is read, the trinket sends back an error packet with code 1 or 2 to alert the user that an error was detected and no action was taken
 *    If data is read correctly but has the wrong AP_ID, the trinket will send back error packet 3
 *    If data is read correctly but is not a command packet, the trinket will send back error packet 4
 *    If data is read correctly but does not have a valid checksum, the trinket will send back error packet 5
 * If the data is good, the following commands apply
 *    A command code of 0 means altitude data will be sent as normal
 *    A command code of 1 means abort so the next data packet should be {1, 0} and the xbee will send back a confirmation packet with time 1
 *    Any other command code means open for the number times 20 seconds so the next data packt should be {0, time in millis}, and the xbee will send back a confirmation packet with the time
 *    
 * The data received will always be "Helios" followed by the transmission number followed by the altitude followed by the ascent velocity
